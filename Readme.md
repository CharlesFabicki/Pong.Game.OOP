# Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game features two paddles and a ball that bounces between them. Players can control the paddles to prevent the ball from passing their side. The objective of the game is to score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle.

## How to Play

- Player 1 (Left Paddle):
  - Move Up: Press the 'w' key.
  - Move Down: Press the 's' key.

- Player 2 (Right Paddle):
  - Move Up: Press the 'Up arrow' key.
  - Move Down: Press the 'Down arrow' key.

The game starts automatically when you run the program. The ball will bounce off the paddles and walls. Each time the ball passes a paddle and goes out of bounds on the opposite side, the opponent gains a point. The game continues until you close the window.
